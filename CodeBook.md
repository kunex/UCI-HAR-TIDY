# UCI HAR TIDY DATASET CODE BOOK
Tomasz Kun 2016.10.10

This code book describes two files: **"tidy_dataset1"**, **"tidy_dataset1"** which are generated by function **"run.analysis.R"** by transforming data from **"UCI HAR Dataset"**.
The output .csv files will be saved in a folder named **"UCI HAR Output Tidy Data"**. Source data is described in **"UCI HAR Dataset/README.txt"** file."

## FUNCTION run.analysis.R

The function run.analysis.R(folder_containing_UCI_HAR_dataset) transforms source data located in folder: "UCI HAR Dataset" into two tidy datasets.

### The function does the following:
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

### Function code described:
* pre sets environment and checks if files output files already exists
* loads and prepares data sources
* unions test and train datasets into one
* merges datasets and keeps only required columns from the dataset, assigns names to columns
* joins activity descriptive name and reorders data frame
* creates another independent dataset
* checks if output directory exists and write results to output files

## OUTPUT DATASETS:

### tidy_dataset1.txt
### tidy_dataset2.txt
